Cedric himself knew nothing
whatever about it. It had never been
even mentioned to him. He knew that
his papa had been an Englishman,
because his mamma had told him so
but then his papa had died when he
was so little a boy that he could not
remember very much about him
except that he was big. and had blue
eyes and a long mustache. and that it
was a splendid thing to be carried
around the room on his shoulder.
